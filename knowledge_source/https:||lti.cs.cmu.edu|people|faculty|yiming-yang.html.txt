( On-going NSF project ; Gopal, PhD Thesis ) A new family of Bayesian von Mices Fischer (vMF) clustering techniques ( Gopal & Yang, ICML 2014 & Supplementary ) Unsupervised clustering and semi-supervised metric learning and supervised classification ( Gopal & Yang, UAI 2014 & Supplimentary ).Concept Graph Learning for Online Education ( NSF project ; Yang et al., WSDM 2015 )Mapping online course materials to Wikipedia categories as the Interlingua (universal concepts) Predicting conceptual dependencies among courses based on partially observed prerequisites Planning customized curriculum for individuals based on backgrounds and goalsMacro-Level Information Fusion for Events and Entities (joint effort with Jaime Carbonell in the DARPA DEFT project)Detecting entities and events of interest in various forms of mentions in text to enable high-precision, semi-structured information fusion and summarization. Using a corporate acquisition event as an example, different (and partially redundant) sentences can mention acquirer, price, date, approvals, joint-management, etc. This multi-aspect information needs to be jointly extracted into a unified structured form for this event type, with uncertainty estimates in the aggregated representation. | Projects: None | Bio: None | Education: None<sep>
