I have also applied my EBMT system to cross-language information retrieval and speech-to-speech translation. Digital Forensics I have worked on reconstructing corrupted ZIP archives and on extracting text in arbitrary encodings from files and raw disk images. As part of this work, I developed language identification for more than 1,300 languages, and am continuing to improve the accuracy with which languages can be identified. Information Extraction My current work focuses on extracting actions and affected components from aircraft maintenance records.<sep>Professor Ralf Brown Projects: None<sep>Professor Ralf Brown Bio: None<sep>Professor Ralf Brown Education: None<sep>
