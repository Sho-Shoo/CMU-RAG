The first emoticon was created by Scott Fahlman, a researcher at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU), in 1982. Fahlman, a computer scientist and cognitive scientist, created the emoticon as a way to help clarify the meaning of messages on computer message boards, as people were having trouble conveying emotions through text-based communication. The emoticon he created was a smiling face with a winking eye, and it has since become a standard symbol in online communication.

According to the BiasX paper, imperfect machine-generated explanations help in correctly identifying subtly (non-)toxic content to a lesser extent compared to expert-written human explanations. The paper shows that participants benefit from explanations when correctly identifying subtly (non-)toxic content, with the quality of explanations being critical. Specifically, the paper states that "imperfect machine-generated explanations (+2.4% on hard toxic examples) help less compared to expert-written human explanations (+7.2%)." This suggests that while machine-generated explanations can provide some benefit, they are less effective than expert-written explanations in correctly identifying subtly (non-)toxic content.

The attention dot-product scores in the Unlimiformer approach are the kNN distances returned by the kNN index. The kNN index is a single index that stores the attention dot-product scores for a given input sequence, allowing for fast and efficient attention computation. In the Unlimiformer approach, the kNN distance is computed between each token in the input sequence and every other token in the input sequence, resulting in a matrix of kNN distances. The kNN distance is a measure of the similarity between two tokens, with lower distances indicating greater similarity. By using the kNN distance as the attention dot-product score, Unlimiformer is able to efficiently attend to all tokens in the input sequence without incurring the computational complexity of computing the attention scores for every token.

The paper "Language Models Get a Gender Makeover" by LTI Prof. Louis-Philippe Morency and colleagues presents an approach to reduce gender bias in pre-trained language models using few-shot data interventions. The authors evaluate the effectiveness of their approach using a set of gender-related words, including "he" and "she."  According to the paper, the mean confidence difference for the "he" and "she" gender-word pairs in the fine-tuned model is 0.28 and 0.32, respectively. These values represent the difference in the model's confidence in generating the correct gender for each word, with higher values indicating a greater bias towards the male or female gender.  The authors note that these results demonstrate the effectiveness of their few-shot data intervention approach in reducing gender bias in pre-trained language models. By fine-tuning the model on a small number of debiased training examples, they are able to significantly reduce the model's tendency to favor any gender, making it a practical and feasible solution for mitigating gender bias in NLP applications.

The paper "Grounding Language Models to Images for Multimodal Generation" by LTI Prof. Daniel Fried suggests that attacking multimodal models that allow users to provide images could involve exploiting the vulnerabilities of diffusion models, which memorize individual images from their training data and emit them at generation time. The authors of the paper extract over a thousand training examples from state-of-the-art models, including photographs of individual people and trademarked company logos, and train hundreds of diffusion models in various settings to analyze how different modeling and data decisions affect privacy. The results show that diffusion models are much less private than prior generative models such as GANs, and that mitigating these vulnerabilities may require new advances in privacy-preserving training.  Therefore, based on the provided paper, an attacker could potentially use techniques such as data poisoning or model inversion to exploit the memorization capabilities of diffusion models and access sensitive information. Data poisoning involves manipulating the training data to influence the model's behavior, while model inversion involves using the model to infer information about the training data. By exploiting these vulnerabilities, an attacker could potentially gain unauthorized access to sensitive information or manipulate the model's output to their advantage.

The Fairness Continual Learning approach proposed in the paper "Fairness Continual Learning Approach to Semantic Scene Understanding in Open-World Environments" by Bhiksha Raj and colleagues introduces two loss functions to address the challenges of continual learning:  1. Prototypical Contrastive Clustering loss: This loss function is proposed to address the significant challenges in continual learning, including catastrophic forgetting and background shift. It is based on class distributions and aims to preserve the knowledge of the previous classes while learning new classes. 2. Conditional Structural Consistency loss: This loss function is designed to regularize the structural constraint of the predicted segmentation and promote fairness in the model predictions. It is based on the conditional probability of the segmentation given the context and the class labels.  Both loss functions are novel and have been proven effective in improving the performance of the semantic segmentation model in open-world environments.

Using a different input representation for predicting the next tokens: kNN-LM uses a different input representation than standard LMs, which allows it to capture more contextual information and improve its performance. 2. Approximate kNN search: kNN-LM uses an approximate search algorithm to find the k nearest neighbors, which is faster and more efficient than the exact search algorithm used in standard LMs. 3. The importance of softmax temperature for the kNN distribution: kNN-LM uses a different temperature parameter in the softmax function to control the spread of the kNN distribution, which helps to improve its performance.

The paper "You might think about slightly revising the title”: Identifying Hedges in Peer-tutoring Interactions by LTI Professor Justine Cassell highlights the benefits of using a hybrid model approach for identifying hedges. A hybrid approach combines pre-trained resources with insights from the social science literature, which outperforms existing baselines while being easier to interpret. The use of a hybrid model approach offers several benefits, including:  1. Improved performance: The hybrid approach outperforms existing baselines, indicating that combining pre-trained resources with social science insights can lead to better hedge identification. 2. Interpretable results: The hybrid model is easier to interpret, as it provides feature explanation through Shapley values, allowing for a deeper understanding of the importance of various features in hedge prediction. 3. Robustness to low rapport: The hybrid approach is more robust to low rapport between the tutor and the tutee, as it incorporates nonverbal behaviors and interpersonal rapport into the model.  Overall, the use of a hybrid model approach offers a more comprehensive and accurate way of identifying hedges in peer-tutoring interactions, which can be valuable in developing tutoring agents that manage rapport with teenagers to improve learning.
According to the paper, the human performance on the proposed benchmark tasks was 78.24%.
An incomplete grade (I) is assigned when a student has been unable to complete the work of a course by the end of the academic semester. The grade of incomplete provides no undue advantage to that student over other students. By awarding an "I" grade, an instructor must specify the requirements for the completion of the work and designate a default letter grade in the event that the student fails to complete the remaining work. The default letter grade is assigned by the instructor and is usually the grade earned up to that point in the course. However, the work completed up to that date must be of passing quality.  In summary, a single letter grade for an incomplete grade is "I".

One of the challenges of navigating in outdoor environments compared to indoor environments is the lack of clear spatial delineations and inherent semantic ambiguities in outdoor environments. Unlike indoor environments, which have structured layouts and clear spatial boundaries, outdoor environments are often vast and complex, with many variables that can affect navigation, such as weather, lighting, and terrain. This makes it more difficult for robots to navigate and reason about the unseen in outdoor environments.

CSurF addresses sparse lexicon-based retrieval by learning to represent each query and document as a "bag-of-CSFs", simultaneously addressing two key factors in sparse retrieval: vocabulary expansion of surface form and semantic representation of term meaning. This is achieved by pairing a lexical surface form with a context source, and representing each CSF by a lexical form weight and a contextualized semantic vector representation. This framework enables efficient matching of CSFs through exact-match of learned surface forms, and effective scoring of each CSF pair via contextual semantic representations, leading to joint improvement in both term match and term scoring.

The proposed forward-backward algorithm in "Deriving Vocal Fold Oscillation Information from Recorded Voice Signals Using Models of Phonation" is called the ADLES-VFT algorithm. It is a joint model that combines a phonation model (with a glottal flow waveform as the output) and a vocal tract acoustic wave propagation model, and it is used to estimate the vocal fold oscillations (VFOs) directly from recorded speech signals on an individualized, speaker-by-speaker basis. The ADLES-VFT algorithm is a forward-backward algorithm that minimizes the error between the recorded waveform and the output of the joint model to estimate its parameters. Once estimated, these parameter values are used in conjunction with a phonation model to obtain the individualized VFOs for each speaker.

Using random walks to estimate entity centrality on conversation entity graphs can improve answer passage ranking. Experiments conducted in the paper "Conversational Search with Random Walks over Entity Graphs" by LTI Prof. Jamie Callan show that using random walks to estimate entity centrality on conversation entity graphs improves top precision answer passage ranking over competitive transformer-based baselines. This is because entity centrality is a measure of the importance of an entity in a conversation, and using random walks to estimate entity centrality can provide a more accurate estimate of an entity's centrality than using other methods. By using a more accurate estimate of entity centrality, the ranking of answer passages can be improved.

The mapping network plays a crucial role in the proposed model in "Generating Images with Multimodal Language Models" by LTI Prof. Daniel Fried. The mapping network is responsible for translating the hidden representations of the text-only large language model (LLM) into the embedding space of the visual models, enabling the fusion of the two modalities. This mapping allows the model to leverage the strong text representations of the LLM for visual outputs, such as image generation and retrieval. By mapping between the two embedding spaces, the model can process image-and-text inputs and produce coherent image and text outputs, outperforming non-LLM based generation models in several text-to-image tasks. In summary, the mapping network is essential for the model's ability to generate images based on multimodal input and output.

SenteCon, a method for introducing human interpretability in deep language representations, has been shown to have a positive impact on predictive performance on downstream tasks. The paper by Morency et al. (2023) presents empirical evaluations indicating that encoding language with SenteCon provides high-level interpretability at little to no cost to predictive performance on downstream tasks. Specifically, the authors find that SenteCon outperforms existing interpretable language representations with respect to both its downstream performance and its agreement with human characterizations of the text. This suggests that SenteCon can help improve the predictive performance of language models by providing a more interpretable and meaningful representation of language.

Multimodal Fusion Interactions: A Study of Human and Automatic Quantification is published in the International Conference on Multimodal Interaction.  The paper's authors are Louis-Philippe Morency, P. Liang, Yun Cheng, R. Salakhutdinov, and CO authors.  The paper's title is Multimodal Fusion Interactions: A Study of Human and Automatic Quantification, and it was published in 2023.  The paper proposes an alternative taxonomy based on information decomposition, where annotators annotate the degrees of redundancy, uniqueness, and synergy relating input modalities with an output task.  The paper also derives upper and lower bounds to quantify the amount of multimodal interactions in a semi-supervised setting with only labeled unimodal data and naturally co-occurring multimodal data.  The paper validates these estimated bounds and shows how they accurately track true interactions.  Finally, the paper explores two semi-supervised multimodal applications based on these theoretical results: analyzing the relationship between multimodal performance and estimated interactions, and self-supervised learning that embraces disagreement between modalities beyond agreement as is typically done.

The aerodynamic characteristics of a buggy are determined by several factors, including its body design, wheel size and placement, and fairings. The most significant factor is the buggy's body design, which can affect its aerodynamics significantly. For example, a buggy with a streamlined body and smooth curves can reduce air resistance and improve its overall aerodynamics. Additionally, the size and placement of the wheels can also impact the buggy's aerodynamics, as larger wheels can create more drag and reduce the buggy's speed. Fairings, which are housing around the wheels, can also help to reduce drag and improve the buggy's aerodynamics by directing airflow around the wheels.  In summary, the design of the buggy's body, wheel size and placement, and the use of fairings all play a crucial role in determining its aerodynamic characteristics.

IPA (Inference-Time Policy Adapters) offers several benefits over fine-tuning when tailoring extreme-scale language models like GPT-3. Here are some of the key advantages:  1. Efficient: IPA does not require fine-tuning the language model, which can be costly and time-consuming. Instead, it adapts the model during decoding time through a lightweight policy adapter trained to optimize an arbitrary user objective with reinforcement learning. 2. Lightweight: IPA is a lightweight approach compared to fine-tuning, which can be computationally expensive. This makes it more feasible for the broader community to use and tailor large language models. 3. Flexibility: IPA allows for tailoring the language model without requiring a specific task or dataset. This makes it more flexible than fine-tuning, which is typically task-specific. 4. Improved performance: IPA consistently brings significant improvements over off-the-shelf language models on various text generation tasks, sometimes even outperforming competitive baseline methods.  Overall, IPA offers a promising alternative to fine-tuning for tailoring extreme-scale language models like GPT-3, providing a more efficient, lightweight, and flexible approach with improved performance.

The BASS paper proposes a solution to address the issue of training end-to-end speech summarization models on very large inputs by using block-wise adaptation. The proposed method allows for training the models on very long sequences in an incremental manner, rather than processing the entire input at once. This is achieved by processing a portion of the input frames at a time and updating the hypothesis summaries every block based on new acoustic information. The paper also devise and test strategies to pass semantic context across the blocks.
The mechanism that is critical to language learning in young children is the ability to infer the mental states of other agents in social environments, coined Theory of Mind (ToM) by Premack&Woodruff (1978). This mechanism allows children to understand the mental states and intentions of others, which is essential for language acquisition. The authors of the provided documents, including Graham Neubig, Yonatan Bisk, and Lei Li, have conducted research on the role of ToM in language learning and have found that incorporating ToM into computational models of language acquisition can lead to improved performance.

The proposed method for grounding pre-trained text-only language models to the visual domain involves leveraging the abilities of language models learnt from large-scale text-only pretraining, such as in-context learning and free-form text generation. The method involves keeping the language model frozen and finetuning input and output linear layers to enable cross-modality interactions. This allows the model to process arbitrarily interleaved image-and-text inputs and generate free-form text interleaved with retrieved images. The approach works with any off-the-shelf language model and paves the way towards an effective, general solution for leveraging pretrained language models in visually grounded settings.

Pengi leverages Transfer Learning by framing all audio tasks as text-generation tasks. It takes an audio recording and text as input and generates free-form text as output. The input audio is represented as a sequence of continuous embeddings by an audio encoder, and a text encoder represents the corresponding text input in the same way. Both sequences are combined as a prefix to prompt a pre-trained frozen language model. This unified architecture enables open-ended tasks and close-ended tasks without any additional fine-tuning or task-specific extensions.

In the Unlimiformer approach, the cross-attention computation is offloaded to a single k-nearest-neighbor (kNN) index. This means that instead of attending to every token in the input sequence, the model only needs to compute the attention scores for the k nearest neighbors, and then use these scores to compute the final output. This approach allows the model to process practically unlimited input sequences without any performance degradation.
